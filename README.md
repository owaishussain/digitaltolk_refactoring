## Feedback Regarding Existent Code

- Using repository pattern which is good.
- Redundancy exist in code not a possitve point.
- Variable names were not consistent. some variables dont had camel case and had speling mistakes.
- eloquent was used with repository pattern which is not a practice.
- validation should have been instead of if-else.




## What I Did

- used service to cut done repository file. By doing that code is more readable for other developers
- used form request instead of if-else in store fuction booking controller.
- shortend some of the code in booking repository file by eleminating extra if-else and unnessary functionality.
- remove the redundant code. 
- i did not change the variable names or fuction names because it break code on mobile or front end

## Suggestions



- implement repository pattern more aggressively.
- use observers and service to shorten the code in repository and controller repectively.
- Traits may also can be used in the project.
## Conclusion

As i had partial code file and dont have reffernce or context of rest of the project and with the time frame of 2 - 4 hours. i implemented some concepts on basic and general idea of the code.
